### Introduction
This paper discusses the usage of SQL UDL(User Defined Functions) and the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
### SQL UDF Usage
User Defined Functions are Functions that are created to perform a task given a parameter(s) and they will return a result(vlaue). UDFs are useful to avoid repetition and improve performance by reducing network traffic. Once a function is defined to perform a task, it can be called as many times as needed.
### Differences in Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
A scalar function accepts one or more parameters and returns a single value. An Inline Function on the other hand returns a set of result as a table. An inline function is very similar to a View except  inline function takes one or more parameters. A Multi-Statement Functions syntax is like the scalar function but instead returns a table-type result set,but the table is explicitly constructed in script.
### Summary
User Defined Functions are functions defined to perform a specific task with a parameter input and a return value. SQL UDF has three different types of functions: scalar, inline and multi-statement functions. A scalar function returns a single value as an output while Inline and Multi-Statement dunctions return a set of values.
